OOP is intended to represent real-world items and their interactions, making programs easier to understand, maintain, and extend. The four main principles of object-oriented programming are encapsulation (bundling data and methods within a class), inheritance (allowing one class to inherit features from another), polymorphism (allowing different classes to be treated through the same interface), and abstraction. OOP encourages systematic and scalable software development by organising code into modular, reusable components."

For example, a Car class could have attributes like colour, brand, and speed, as well as methods like accelerate() and brake(). When you create an object from this class, such as my_car = Car(), you receive a specific car with its own data that is based on the Car class's structure.

Abstraction is the process of concealing complex implementation details and exposing only the most important characteristics of an object to the outside world. It reduces complexity by emphasising what an object does rather than how it accomplishes it. For example, when driving a car, all you need to know is how to drive it—you don't need to know how the engine works. Encapsulation, on the other hand, is the process of enclosing data and methods that operate on it within a single unit, usually a class, and restricting access to some of the object's components. This is usually done using access modifiers like private, protected, and public to control visibility. Encapsulation ensures that an object’s internal state is protected from unintended interference and misuse. In short, abstraction deals with hiding implementation complexity, while encapsulation deals with hiding data to enforce security and integrity."

Protected members are identified with a single underscore (e.g., _balance), indicating that they should not be accessed directly, though this is still allowed. Public members, who can be accessed from outside the class, do not have an underscore prefix.

For example, in a class Student, you could use the constructor to set the student's name and age during object construction. The __init__ method accepts parameters (other than self) and receives values given during instantiation. Although Python also has a __new__ method, which is responsible for creating a new instance before __init__ is called, it’s used mostly in advanced cases like customizing object creation in immutable classes.

A static method, on the other hand, is declared with the @staticmethod decorator and does not accept any parameters from self or cls. It works like a standard function but is stored within the class's namespace for logical grouping. Static methods do not access or modify class or instance attributes—they are used when some utility function is logically related to the class but doesn’t need access to class or object-specific data.

To achieve comparable behaviour, developers typically utilise default arguments, also known as *args and **args, to allow a single method to accommodate a variety of inputs. This manner, the method may check the arguments at runtime and respond appropriately.

        "- The distinction between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python is how they interact with the class and its instances. A method marked with @staticmethod does not accept any special first arguments, such as self or cls. It behaves like a typical function that is defined within a class but does not have access to the class or instance properties. It is commonly used for utility functions that are conceptually connected to the class but do not require access to its data. In contrast, a method marked with @classmethod accepts cls as its first argument, which refers to the class rather than an instance. This allows it to access or modify class-level variables and is useful for creating factory methods or performing operations that affect the class as a whole. While both decorators allow you to call the method using the class name, @classmethod is aware of the class context, whereas @staticmethod is completely independent of it."

        "- Polymorphism in Python integrates with inheritance by allowing objects from various subclasses to be viewed as objects from a common superclass while retaining their own distinct behaviour. Method overriding allows a subclass to offer its own implementation of a method defined in the parent class. When a method is called on an object, Python selects which version of the method to execute based on the object's real type rather than the reference's type. For example, if a superclass Animal has a method speak(), and subclasses Dog and Cat override this method with their own specific behaviors, calling speak() on a list of Animal objects—some of which are Dog, some Cat—will result in the appropriate method being called for each object. This dynamic method resolution enables polymorphism, making code more flexible, extensible, and easier to maintain by allowing the same interface to be used with different underlying forms."

        "- Method chaining is a Python OOP programming technique that calls several methods on the same object in a single, continuous line of code. This is accomplished by creating methods that return the object itself—typically using return self at the conclusion of each function—so that further method calls can be appended. Method chaining improves code readability and conciseness, particularly when executing many operations on the same object. For example, in a class representing a text editor, you may write \"editor.\"set_font(\"Arial\").set_size(12).set_color(\"blue\"), linking all setup steps together. This approach not only produces cleaner code, but it also correlates well with the fluent interfaces typically employed in modern APIs. However, it requires careful method design to ensure each call correctly returns the expected object for the next method in the chain."

        "- The __call__ method in Python is a special method that allows an instance of a class to be called like a regular function. When a class defines the __call__ method, you can use its objects with parentheses, as if you were calling a function. This adds function-like behavior to objects, enabling more flexible and intuitive interfaces. The main purpose of __call__ is to encapsulate behavior in an object that needs to maintain state between calls or when function-like objects are more suitable than standalone functions. For example, you might use it in a class that wraps a machine learning model, where calling the object directly runs a prediction. This method supports the principle of callable objects, making classes behave more dynamically and integrating smoothly with Python’s functional programming features."
